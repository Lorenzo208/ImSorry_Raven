            <p class="letterText"><b>Dear Raven,</b><br><br>I hope you're doing well. I've been doing some thinking, and I realize I owe you an apology.<br><br>I've let my feelings get a bit possessive, and I see now that it might have made things uncomfortable for you. I'm sorry for that. Also, I shouldn't have let my insecurities make me question your friendships. That was my mistake. I never wanted to push you away, but I see that I might have. I want you to be happy, and if I've hindered that in any way, I'm truly sorry.<br><br>Things been too much to both of us lately, we used to be loving and kind to each other.. All of those sweet words, beautiful memories, and loving act to each other is what i do miss from both of us, Rae.. i don't want what we have all this time ended only for such small issue, and i won't let someone else destroy what we have and cherish at the most.. I still wanna be in some calls with you, watching some movies and laugh along with each other, you're someone special that i found in Kaji.. It might be hard for us to go back to that beautiful memories, we both know if the first step will always be the hardest, but i promise you if i'll always be there for every step that we take, i promise if i'll always be there for you during your high and low as someone who truly care about you, i won't ever leave you alone when you need me, and i won't make any drama as long as you care about my feelings. <br><br>I'm tired with all the problems that we have, i don't want us to end this way. I still wanna see your cute face and see your smiles. I wanna be there for you, supporting each other like we used to do, making each other smile, and giving all the attention like we used do. I wanna make things right between us, Rae.. <br><br>Love should be freeing, not confining, and I want to give you that space. I'm working on being more mindful and understanding. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I value what we have, and I want to make it right.</p><br>

Let me learn to cherish you with the freedom you deserve, my beautiful rose."</p>
